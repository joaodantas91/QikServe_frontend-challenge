## Assumptions

As the description of the challenge restricted which technologies were allowed to be used, I assumed that the test was intended to evaluate the bases, and test whether I could do the features without facilitating libraries

  

## Process and Choices

Right from the start of the project it was very challenging, I had to make decisions that would impact on the construction of the project, for example on how to show the Item Page as a screen that covered everything and then as a modal, following a similar reasoning with the Cart too, where I wanted to reuse the styling code and be able to present them in the same way.
I had experience using Zustand for state management and this experience helped me understand how to structure Redux and showed me how robust it is.
